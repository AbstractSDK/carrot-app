## Carrot Savings

Welcome to the Carrot Savings App documentation! Buckle up, because this isn't your typical product manual. We built the Carrot App with a passion for transparency and want to share the journey with you, step-by-step. It's all part of our mission to push the boundaries on ownership and trust in DeFi. Here's the thing: we don't own the Carrot, there are no shareholders â€“ everyone owns their own Carrot, making it truly MyFi.

This guide will introduce the Carrot App and take you behind the scenes of its development.

## The Carrot in a Nutshell

the Carrot Savings App is a self-hosted interchain yield aggregator designed to offer you the best stablecoin yields available.
Unlike traditional DeFi Apps where users engage with a single or a suite of smart contracts deployed on-chain, the Carrot App is a self-hosted application, allowing you to configure the application to your needs with improved trustlessness.

### Key Features (the Good Stuff):

- Effortless Onboarding: Forget the complexities of traditional DeFi manual interactions and micromanagement of your funds. Carrot Savings eliminates the need to understand intricate smart contracts or manage multiple protocols.
- Streamlined Installation: Install the app on your Abstract account with ease, similar to installing apps on your phone.
- Predefined Strategies: Leverage pre-configured, optimized yield strategies for maximum returns.
- Automated Management: Sit back and relax while the app automatically compounds your yield and manages your stablecoins.
